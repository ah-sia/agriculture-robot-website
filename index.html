		<h1>Project Description</h1>
		<p>This project is called the Agriculture Robot. The robot is designed and programmed to be able to roam around a field of crops, check the weather and temperature, monitor how the plants are doing, if the plants are getting enough nutrients, and if there are unidentified animals or individuals. The robot can also generate analysis of these information, and send reports and alerts.
